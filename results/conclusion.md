**Conclusion**

This study examines the relationship between investor knowledge and investment decision-making, with particular emphasis on knowledge of the United States–China trade war, general investment knowledge, and risk perception. Using survey-based data and multiple regression frameworks, the analysis seeks to assess whether these factors are systematically associated with investment decisions and whether such relationships are robust across alternative modeling approaches.

The empirical results indicate that knowledge of the US–China trade war exhibits a consistent and statistically significant association with investment decision outcomes. This finding is preserved across classical Ordinary Least Squares estimation, heteroskedasticity-robust inference, and Ridge regression, providing confidence in the stability of the estimated relationship. In contrast, general investment knowledge and risk perception do not demonstrate statistically meaningful effects, suggesting that contextual macroeconomic awareness plays a more prominent role than abstract financial knowledge or subjective risk assessments in this setting.

Robustness checks and diagnostic evaluations support the methodological validity of the analysis. Tests for heteroskedasticity and multicollinearity do not indicate severe violations of classical regression assumptions, and residual diagnostics suggest that the linear specification provides a reasonable approximation to the underlying data structure. Penalized regression further highlights the limited predictive power of the model under strict sparsity constraints, reinforcing the distinction between statistical inference and predictive performance in behavioral finance research.

While the overall explanatory power of the model is modest, this outcome is consistent with the complex and heterogeneous nature of individual investment behavior. The findings should therefore be interpreted as evidence of a statistically credible relationship rather than as a comprehensive explanation of investment decision-making. The study contributes to the literature by demonstrating that knowledge of salient geopolitical events can influence investor behavior, even in the presence of substantial unobserved variation.

In conclusion, this research underscores the importance of contextual economic knowledge as a behavioral factor in investment decision-making. By replicating and extending prior analysis using modern statistical tools, the study provides a transparent and methodologically sound examination of investor behavior. Future research employing richer data structures and Bayesian modeling frameworks may further enhance understanding of how information, uncertainty, and individual heterogeneity jointly shape investment decisions.
