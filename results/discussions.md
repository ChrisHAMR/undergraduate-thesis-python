**4.1 Interpretation of Key Findings**

The primary objective of this study is to examine the relationship between investor knowledge and investment decision-making, with particular emphasis on knowledge of the United States–China trade war (X2), general investment knowledge (X1), and risk perception (X3). Across all model specifications, a consistent pattern emerges: knowledge of the US–China trade war is the only predictor that exhibits a stable and statistically meaningful association with investment decision behavior.

In the baseline Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model replicated from SPSS, the coefficient on X2 is positive and statistically significant at the 1% level. This indicates that greater awareness and understanding of the US–China trade conflict is associated with higher investment decision scores, holding other factors constant. The magnitude and direction of this effect are preserved exactly in the Python-based OLS replication, confirming that the computational implementation faithfully reproduces the original SPSS analysis.

In contrast, general investment knowledge (X1) does not exhibit a statistically significant relationship with investment decisions. While the estimated coefficient is negative, its magnitude is small and not distinguishable from zero across all specifications. This suggests that broad conceptual familiarity with investment concepts alone may be insufficient to meaningfully influence investor behavior in this setting, particularly when compared to knowledge of salient macroeconomic or geopolitical events.

Similarly, risk perception (X3) does not demonstrate a statistically significant effect on investment decisions. The lack of significance persists across classical OLS, heteroskedasticity-robust inference, and penalized regression models. This finding suggests that perceived risk, at least as measured in the survey instrument, does not directly translate into observable differences in investment decision outcomes within the sampled population.

Importantly, the substantive conclusion regarding X2 remains intact under multiple robustness checks. Re-estimation using heteroskedasticity-robust (HC3) standard errors yields identical coefficient estimates and preserves the statistical significance of X2 at the 5% level. This indicates that the observed relationship is not driven by violations of homoskedasticity assumptions.

Further support for the central role of X2 is provided by penalized regression methods. Ridge regression, which shrinks coefficient magnitudes while retaining all predictors, identifies X2 as the dominant coefficient in relative terms. Although the absolute magnitude is reduced due to standardization and penalization, X2 remains clearly larger than the coefficients associated with X1 and X3. This suggests that the influence of trade-war knowledge is not an artifact of multicollinearity or overfitting.

In contrast, Lasso regression with cross-validated penalty selection shrinks all slope coefficients to zero, selecting an intercept-only model. This result indicates that while X2 is statistically significant under classical inference, the overall predictive signal in the model is weak when sparse predictive modeling is enforced. However, sensitivity analysis using a weaker ℓ1 penalty recovers X2 as the dominant predictor, consistent with the OLS and Ridge results.

Taken together, these findings suggest that knowledge of the US–China trade war plays a uniquely influential role in shaping investment decisions, relative to general investment knowledge and risk perception. The consistency of this result across multiple modeling frameworks supports its substantive credibility, while also highlighting the modest overall explanatory power of the model, an issue addressed in the subsequent sections.

**4.2. Model Fit and Explanatory Power**

The baseline regression model explains approximately 13.6 percent of the variation in the dependent variable, as indicated by an R² value of 0.136. While this level of explanatory power may appear modest, it is consistent with empirical findings in cross-sectional studies of individual investment behavior, particularly those based on survey data. Investment decisions are influenced by a wide range of unobserved psychological, social, and contextual factors that are difficult to measure comprehensively within a single empirical specification.

The relatively low R² should therefore not be interpreted as evidence of model inadequacy. Rather, it reflects the inherently complex and heterogeneous nature of investor decision-making, where observable explanatory variables capture only a portion of the underlying behavioral processes. In such contexts, the primary objective of regression analysis is not high predictive accuracy, but credible estimation of marginal relationships between theoretically relevant variables and the outcome of interest.

This interpretation is further supported by the stability of the estimated coefficients across alternative modeling approaches. Despite the modest overall explanatory power, the coefficient associated with knowledge of the US–China trade war remains statistically significant under classical OLS, heteroskedasticity-robust inference, and Ridge regression. This consistency suggests that the identified relationship is not driven by overfitting or spurious correlations, but represents a meaningful association within the limits of the available data.

Penalized regression results provide additional insight into the model’s predictive structure. The selection of an intercept-only model by Lasso regression under cross-validated penalty choice indicates that the explanatory variables collectively offer limited predictive improvement when strict sparsity constraints are imposed. This outcome is consistent with the low R² observed in the baseline model and highlights the distinction between statistical significance and predictive performance in behavioral data.

Overall, the model’s explanatory power is best understood as a reflection of the study’s scope and design rather than a methodological shortcoming. The results demonstrate that, although a substantial proportion of variation in investment decisions remains unexplained, the estimated effect of geopolitical knowledge is statistically robust and substantively interpretable within a behavioral finance framework.

**4.3. Robustness and Methodological Validity**

To assess the reliability of the estimated relationships, a series of robustness checks and diagnostic procedures were conducted. These checks aim to evaluate whether the baseline findings are sensitive to violations of classical regression assumptions or to alternative estimation strategies.

Heteroskedasticity-robust inference was implemented using HC3 standard errors. Re-estimation of the baseline model under this framework yields coefficient estimates identical to those obtained under classical OLS, while preserving the statistical significance of knowledge of the US–China trade war at conventional levels. This result indicates that the primary inference is not driven by heteroskedasticity and remains valid under a more conservative variance estimation procedure.

Multicollinearity was assessed using variance inflation factors. The values associated with the explanatory variables are close to unity, suggesting minimal linear dependence among predictors. The absence of substantial multicollinearity implies that coefficient estimates are stable and interpretable, and that the estimated effects are not inflated due to redundant information among the regressors.

Additional diagnostic assessments were performed through graphical inspection of residuals. The residuals versus fitted values plot does not reveal systematic patterns indicative of nonlinearity or heteroskedasticity, while the residual distribution and Q–Q plot indicate approximate normality with mild deviations in the tails. These deviations are not uncommon in survey-based data and do not undermine the validity of inference, particularly given the use of robust standard errors.

Penalized regression methods provide a complementary perspective on robustness by examining coefficient stability under regularization. Ridge regression shrinks coefficient magnitudes toward zero while retaining all predictors, yet continues to assign the largest relative weight to knowledge of the US–China trade war. This suggests that the central finding is not an artifact of overfitting or noise amplification in the baseline model.

In contrast, Lasso regression with cross-validated penalty selection favors a parsimonious intercept-only specification, indicating limited sparse predictive structure in the data. While this result highlights the weak predictive power of the model under strict sparsity assumptions, it does not contradict the inferential validity of the OLS estimates. Instead, it underscores the distinction between explanatory modeling aimed at understanding relationships and predictive modeling aimed at maximizing out-of-sample performance.

Taken together, the results of these robustness checks support the methodological validity of the analysis. The consistency of the estimated effect of geopolitical knowledge across classical, robust, and regularized frameworks strengthens confidence in the substantive conclusion, while also acknowledging the inherent limitations of the data and modeling approach.

**4.4. Implications for Investment Decision-Making**

The findings of this study offer several implications for understanding investor behavior and the role of information in shaping investment decisions. The consistent significance of knowledge related to the US–China trade war suggests that investors respond more strongly to salient macroeconomic and geopolitical information than to general investment knowledge or abstract perceptions of risk. This highlights the importance of contextual awareness in influencing investment behavior, particularly in environments characterized by uncertainty and rapid information flow.

The lack of statistical significance for general investment knowledge implies that familiarity with basic financial concepts alone may not be sufficient to alter decision-making outcomes. Instead, investors appear to place greater weight on information that directly affects market conditions or signals potential shifts in economic fundamentals. This suggests that investor education initiatives may be more effective when they emphasize the interpretation of real-world economic events, rather than focusing exclusively on theoretical financial literacy.

Similarly, the absence of a significant relationship between risk perception and investment decisions indicates that perceived risk does not necessarily translate into observable behavioral changes in this context. This finding may reflect limitations in how risk perception is measured, or it may suggest that investors internalize risk in a manner that does not directly affect their stated investment choices. In either case, the result underscores the complexity of behavioral responses to risk and cautions against assuming a direct correspondence between perceived risk and decision outcomes.

From a policy and practical perspective, the results suggest that timely and accurate dissemination of macroeconomic and geopolitical information can play a meaningful role in shaping investment behavior. Market participants who are better informed about global economic developments may be more capable of adjusting their decisions in response to evolving conditions. However, the modest explanatory power of the model also indicates that such information constitutes only one of many factors influencing investment decisions.

Overall, the findings emphasize the role of contextual economic knowledge as a behavioral channel in investment decision-making. While the effects identified in this study are statistically robust, they operate within a broader decision environment characterized by substantial heterogeneity and unobserved influences. As such, the implications should be interpreted as indicative rather than determinative, pointing toward the importance of integrating behavioral considerations into analyses of investor behavior.

**4.5. Limitations**

Several limitations of this study should be acknowledged when interpreting the results. These limitations do not invalidate the findings but provide important context regarding the scope and generalizability of the analysis.

First, the study relies on cross-sectional survey data, which restricts the ability to infer causal relationships. While statistically significant associations can be identified, the analysis cannot establish the direction of causality between investor knowledge and investment decision-making. Unobserved factors, such as prior investment experience or personality traits, may influence both knowledge acquisition and decision outcomes.

Second, the measurement of key constructs is based on self-reported survey responses. Such measures are subject to potential biases, including response bias and measurement error. Although composite variables are constructed to improve reliability, some degree of noise in the explanatory variables is likely to remain, which may attenuate estimated effects.

Third, the relatively modest sample size limits the statistical power of the analysis and may constrain the detection of smaller effects. This limitation is particularly relevant in the context of penalized regression, where strict regularization can eliminate predictors that exhibit statistical significance under classical inference. As a result, the predictive performance of the models should be interpreted with caution.

Finally, the set of explanatory variables included in the model is necessarily incomplete. Investment decision-making is influenced by a wide range of psychological, social, and institutional factors that are not fully captured in the available data. The omission of such variables may contribute to the low explanatory power observed in the regression models and highlights the need for more comprehensive data in future research.

These limitations underscore the importance of interpreting the results as indicative rather than exhaustive. They also motivate the exploration of alternative modeling approaches and richer data structures, which are discussed in the following section.

**4.6. Future Research Directions**

Future research may extend the present analysis in several directions to address the limitations identified above and to deepen understanding of investment decision-making under uncertainty. One promising avenue involves the application of Bayesian regression frameworks, which allow for a more explicit treatment of parameter uncertainty and model flexibility. Bayesian approaches provide full posterior distributions of coefficients rather than point estimates, offering richer inference in settings characterized by limited sample sizes and noisy measurements.

In particular, Bayesian hierarchical models could be employed to capture heterogeneity across investor subgroups, such as differences in experience, demographic characteristics, or investment objectives. By allowing partial pooling of information across groups, hierarchical modeling may improve estimation stability while preserving meaningful variation in behavioral responses. This approach is especially relevant in survey-based studies, where individual-level responses often exhibit substantial heterogeneity.

Future work could also benefit from longitudinal or panel data designs. Observing investors over time would enable analysis of how investment decisions evolve in response to changing macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, thereby improving causal interpretation. Such data structures would allow researchers to examine dynamic effects, including learning processes and adjustment behavior, that cannot be captured in a cross-sectional framework.

Methodologically, extensions to non-linear or latent-variable models may help address measurement error in survey constructs such as risk perception and knowledge. Bayesian models are particularly well-suited for incorporating latent structures and prior information, which may enhance interpretability and robustness when observable measures are imperfect proxies for underlying behavioral traits.

Finally, integrating richer informational environments, such as real-time news exposure or sentiment indicators, could further illuminate the role of contextual knowledge in shaping investment behavior. By combining survey data with external data sources, future research may provide a more comprehensive account of how macroeconomic and geopolitical information influences investor decision-making.
